# Implementation of Traces
There are 2 part to Implement Traces
# 1. Developer
A developer of the application they have to do instrumentation In their application simmilarly how they instrument the ``Metrics``, and ``Logs``. 
There are multiple languages each programming language has some module, plugin, library. but prefer standart is to use ``open telemetry``. 

Open telemetry is vendor netral, let's say tommorrow if you want to move from one tracing tools to other it would be easy, but there are multiple standart, multiple module which can help you to write a tracing in your application. 

tracing can be more that is not only from service to service but you can also define instrumentation or tracing at the ``function level``, so you can understand from which function of a service the application route to another function, from there it goes to another service. and This part belongs to developer.

you can see some example of instrumentation the tracing in ``part-04 folder``.

# 2. Devops / SRE
Devops engineer they set up a kubernetes cluster, they set up the required configuration and Install and configure ``Jaegger`` or other traces tools. 

Only both of these things are done. you can implement distributed tracing, If one of these things not there the tracing won't distribute properly. let's say you are Devops engineer you have created kubernetes cluster, you have installed Jaegger using Helm, and you have configured other configuration. and The Developer of your organization did not Instrument the traces and eventually there is no point or you will have minimalistic.
